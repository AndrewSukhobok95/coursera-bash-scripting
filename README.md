# coursera-bash-scripting

This repository contains files related to some guided projects on coursera, that I completed to get better understanding of shell scripting.

This list of accomplished courses:

- [Shell Scripting with Bash: Basics](https://www.coursera.org/projects/bash-shell-scripting)
- [Automation Scripts Using Bash](https://www.coursera.org/learn/auto-scripts-bash/)
